# Development

Pure HTML/CSS/Javascript website.
Used [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) to generate the skeleton.
Used [colourlovers.com](http://colourlovers.com) for the color swatches.
Using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) for all the Styling.
`app.sass` contains all the styling. Whenever you edit this file, you need to re-generate the CSS by running:

```
sass css/app.sass css/app.css
```

Or if you want it to automatically update as and when you change, run:

```
sass --watch css/app.sass
```
