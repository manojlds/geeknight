# Development

Pure HTML/CSS/Javascript website.
Used colourlovers.com for the color swatches.
Using SASS and Foundation for all the Styling.
`app.sass` contains all the styling. Whenever you edit this file, you need to re-generate the CSS by running:

```
sass css/app.sass css/app.css
```

Or if you want it to automatically update as and when you change, run:
  
```
sass --watch css/app.sass
```
