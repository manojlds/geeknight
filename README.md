# Development

Pure HTML/CSS/Javascript website.
Used [HTML5 Boilerplate](//html5boilerplate.com) to generate the skeleton.
Used [colourlovers.com](//colourlovers.com) for the color swatches.
Using [SASS](//sass-lang.com) and [Foundation](//foundation.zurb.com) for all the Styling.
`app.sass` contains all the styling. Whenever you edit this file, you need to re-generate the CSS by running:

```
sass css/app.sass css/app.css
```

Or if you want it to automatically update as and when you change, run:

```
sass --watch css/app.sass
```

# Icons

Icon fonts were generated and downloaded from [Fontello](//fontello.com). Only icons from the *Modern Pictogram* set were used for consistency.
